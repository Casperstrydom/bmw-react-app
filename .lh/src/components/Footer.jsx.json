BMW, in full Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, is a German automaker \r\n-            noted for quality sports sedans and motorcycles. Headquarters are in Munich.\r\n-            <strong>It originated in 1916 as Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke,</strong> a builder of aircraft engines, but assumed \r\n-            the name Bayerische Motoren Werke in July 1917 and began producing motorcycles in the 1920s. BMW entered the automobile \r\n-            business in 1928. The company’s R32 motorcycle set a world speed record that was not broken until 1937. During World War II, \r\n-            BMW built the world’s first jet airplane engines, used by the Luftwaffe, Germany’s air force. After the war, the company tried \r\n-            to move into the small-car market but found that it could not compete effectively against Volkswagen’s compact, inexpensive autos. \r\n-            By 1959 the company was on the verge of bankruptcy, and its managers were planning to sell the firm to Daimler-Benz.\r\n-            <strong>In that year, however, BMW pulled out of its financial slump;</strong> German entrepreneur Herbert Quandt acquired a controlling \r\n-            interest in the firm, and BMW introduced its 700 series, soon followed by the equally successful 1500 model. At about the same time, \r\n-            the company introduced a new series of motorcycles that were particularly popular in the United States.\r\n-            <strong>BMW was firmly established as a premium automobile brand by the end of the 20th century.</strong>\r\n-          </p>\r\n           <h2>{data?.title}</h2>\r\n           <h1>BMW PROJECT</h1>\r\n         </div>\r\n         <button onClick={handleToggleModal}>\r\n"
